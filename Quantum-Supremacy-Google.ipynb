    "The purpose of this document is to gain insight into Google's recently published work in which they have claimed to achieve Quantum Supremacy. Their claim has been brought into question by IBM, but achieve is still impressive nonetheless. IBM claims that classical computers can simulate the algorithm in 3 days, that Google said would take 10,000 years to simulate. \n",

    "Google created a processor named 'Sycamore' that has 54 qubits (53 working qubits). The qubits were arranged in a lattice so that so that each qubit is connects to four neighboring qubits. \n",
